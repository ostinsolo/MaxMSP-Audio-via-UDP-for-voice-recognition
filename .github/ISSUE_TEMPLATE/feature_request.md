## 🚀 **Feature Description**
A clear description of the feature you'd like to see.

## 🎯 **Problem/Use Case**
What audio workflow problem would this solve? What's your current workaround?

## 🎛️ **Proposed Solution**
Describe how you envision this feature working.

## 🔧 **Technical Approach** (Optional)
If you have ideas about implementation:
- Changes to MaxMSP device (`UDP AUDIO.amxd`)
- Node.js script modifications
- New dependencies or libraries
- Integration points with Ableton Live

## 📊 **Priority Category**

- [ ] **🌐 Network Performance** (UDP optimization, packet loss handling)
- [ ] **🎤 Speech Recognition** (accuracy, language models)
- [ ] **🔧 Developer Experience** (debugging, installation, testing)
- [ ] **🎵 Audio Quality** (latency, sample rate support)
- [ ] **📱 Platform Support** (Windows, Linux compatibility)

## 💡 **Examples/References**
- Similar implementations in other projects
- Audio software that does this well
- Technical resources or documentation

## 🎵 **Audio Workflow Context**
- [ ] Live performance
- [ ] Studio recording
- [ ] Voice recognition/transcription
- [ ] Real-time audio effects
- [ ] Multi-track recording
- [ ] Network streaming

## 📈 **Success Criteria**
How would we know this feature is working well?
- [ ] Specific performance metrics (latency < 10ms)
- [ ] Compatibility requirements (works with Ableton Live 11+)
- [ ] User experience goals (single-click setup)

## 🤝 **Implementation Offer**
- [ ] I can help implement this
- [ ] I can test this feature
